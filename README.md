# React Markdown Editor

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React

Made with the help of Markdown component for React. I was thinking about how to make my own markdown language editor that I would be able to use the <a href="https://www.grammarly.com">Grammerly</a> browser extension. So far it works well but is not compatible with the GitHub flavored Markdown.

At a later point I will add GitHub markup syntax and a way to download your markdown files.

## Lessons Learned:

Although this project was supposed to be straightforward it was actually difficult to wrap my head around CSS grid. I tried to use Tailwind CSS and just decided to go vanilla CSS. Once that was straightened out it was smooth sailing.
